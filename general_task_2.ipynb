    "We know that computers are really good at number crunching; because of this, they're very often associated with areas like Maths and Physics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**But** computers can also be used to play with *language* in cool ways. You've probably encountered a lot of language based technologies already -- chat interfaces, like ChatGPT, and even more basic things like the predictive text function on your phone. In the world of Literature, scholars have develeoped a whole other way of thinking about texts using computation called *distant reading* (where they look at high-level trends as opposed to doing a *close reading*, which is a small or highly-targeted in-depth analysis).\n",

    "#### Getting some texts\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to grab some text to work with from the internet. In text analysis, you often work with groups of realted documents which together form a *corpus*. Our corpus today is going to be collections of plays of different genres written by Shakespeare\n",
    "\n",
    "The below code fetches them and stores the data into a list of dictionaries. The keys of each dictionary are the play's title, its genre, and its full text. **You don't need to know how this code works**, but you are welcome to poke away at it to try to figure it out.\n",

    "*We* know what all this means but the computer, dumb rock that it is, has no idea. Computers see everything as a series of 1s and 0s. The computer doesn't *know* what a stage direction is, what a character name is, or even what a *word* is. We have to teach it what collections of 1s and 0s matter to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of dividing up the text into those meaningful collections -- which we'll call **tokens** is called *tokenization*. For today, we're going to use the **word** as the smallest unit we care about, so our tokens will be individual words. We're only going to care about words spoken as part of *dialogue*. This menas that we're going to discard any of the text enclosed in angled brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your first task is to write a function to tokenize a text**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the smallest unit python 'understands' is an individual character. That means that tokenization looks like looping over each character and deciding to either stick it to the end of a sequence of characters that will eventually make up a new word, or knowing that a given character indicates the end of a word and stopping the adding process (and adding the completed word to a running list of tokens).\n",
    "\n",
    "This means we have to brainstorm all of the scenarios that indicate the end of a word. We should probably start a new token if:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We hit a piece of puncutuation that *isn't* an apostrophe (sometimes you might to this differently, but for not we don't want posessives to be different tokens)\n",
